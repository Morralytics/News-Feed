# News-Feed

For this project I will be creating a News Feed where users can submit links to tech-related articles, comment on other user's articles, and upvote articles utilizing Python as the main programming language in the backend. 

The goal is to take Javascript fundamentals like Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and Handlebars.js and transfer these skills to a brand new language that uses new packages unfamiliar to me and expand my pool of knowledge.

Since Python is a popular alternative to Node.js, I will be learning this along side my refining process for Javascript.

## Description

News Feed is a news tech site where users can submit links to tech-related articles, comment on other user's articles, and upvote articles utilizing Python as the main programming language in the backend.

The goal is to expand upon my knowledge in Javascript fundamentals like Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and Handlebars.js and transfer these skills to a brand new language that uses new packages unfamiliar to me.

Since Python is a popular alternative to Node.js, I will be learning this alongside my refining process for Javascript.

Python is a great alternative that has many built in modules that can be imported and called upon in a variety of situations. The technology I ended up making use of the most was Python's ORM tool called SQLAlchemy which is what created my models and use the global Session object to perform the necessary CRUD operations.
